# <Minnesota Boot Camp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

Prework study guide for the Minnesota Boot Camp, going over the basics of HTML, git usage, CSS, and JavaScript code for use on live webpages. I was motivated to use this as my first stepping stone to professional coding, and am excited to see how my projects compare to this at the end of the bootcamp. I built this project to get started coding and to also use as a benchmark for my progress in six months. It solves problems on how to implement CSS, HTML, and JS code in a practical setting and debugging, in addition to learning how to publish it live on GitHub. I learned the fundamentals of coding from this project that will be the building blocks for the rest of the bootcamp.
